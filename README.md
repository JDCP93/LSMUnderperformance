# LSM Underperformance Tied to Specific Meteorological Conditions

This repository serves as the code repository for the paper titled "Land Surface Model Underperformance Tied to Specific Meteorological Conditions" (at initial submission) by Cranko Page et al.


The initial data is produced via [modelevaluation.org](https://modelevaluation.org/) using the [PLUMBER2 dataset](https://researchdata.edu.au/plumber2-forcing-evaluation-surface-models/1656048) and the LSM output submitted to the PLUMBER2 benchmarking experiment. The LSM data is available after (free) registration at modelevaluation.org where the owners had no legal barriers preventing public open access.

The code for the PLUMBER2 dataset is at [github](https://github.com/aukkola/PLUMBER2).
The code for modelevaluation.org is available at [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/modelevaluation/me.org-r-library). 

Papers have been published on the [PLUMBER2 dataset](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-449-2022) and the [initial PLUMBER2 experiment results](https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-5517-2024).
